### About the project
This repo is the home for version 2 of my portfolio. A Next Typescript project, with heavy use of [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) using the Rect wrapper [Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber).
The project is connected to [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) (headless CMS) to host my projects, and loads all the projects dynamically. 


### Demo
